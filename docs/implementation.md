## 2. Architecture

### Request Lifecycle

```
Browser
  ↓
Vercel Edge Network
  ↓
middleware.ts (JWT verification — runs before every request)
  ↓ (authenticated)              ↓ (unauthenticated)
Next.js App Router          Redirect → /login
  ↓                         401 JSON (API routes)
Page Component / API Route Handler
  ↓
Prisma Client (singleton — lib/prisma.ts)
  ↓
Neon PostgreSQL (pooled connection)
```

### Rendering Strategy

| Route type            | Strategy                   | Reason                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/login`, `/register` | Client Component           | Form interactivity required                                    |
| `/dashboard`          | Server Component (default) | Data fetched server-side; no client state needed at page level |
| `/api/*`              | Route Handler              | REST API — JSON responses                                      |
| `middleware.ts`       | Edge Runtime               | Runs before rendering; must be Edge-compatible                 |

### Auth Flow

```
Register:
  Client → POST /api/auth/register → Zod validate → bcrypt hash → prisma.user.create → 201

Login:
  Client → POST /api/auth/login → Zod validate → prisma.user.findUnique → bcrypt.compare → SignJWT → Set HTTP-only cookie → 200

Protected request:
  Browser sends cookie automatically → middleware.ts reads cookie → jwtVerify → next() or redirect

Logout:
  Client → POST /api/auth/logout → Clear cookie (Max-Age=0) → 200 → client redirects to /login
```

## 4. Infrastructure

### Database — Neon

**Provider:** neon.tech
**Plan:** Free tier
**Engine:** PostgreSQL 16
**Connection mode:** Pooled (runtime) + Direct (migrations)

**Connection string format:**

```
Pooled:  postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST-pooler.region.aws.neon.tech/DATABASE?sslmode=require
Direct:  postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST.region.aws.neon.tech/DATABASE?sslmode=require
```

**Prisma datasource configuration:**

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")      ← pooled — used at runtime
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")        ← direct — used by prisma migrate
}
```

**Known constraint:** Neon free tier pauses compute after a period of inactivity. Cold start on resume is under 1 second. Acceptable for a portfolio project. Not suitable for production applications with SLA requirements.

---

### Deployment — Vercel

**Provider:** vercel.com
**Plan:** Hobby (free)
**Trigger:** Push to `develop` → preview deployment. Push to `main` → production deployment.
**Framework preset:** Next.js (auto-detected)
**Build command:** `next build` (default)
**Output directory:** `.next` (default)

**Environment scopes:**

- Preview — `develop` branch deployments
- Production — `main` branch deployments (active from Sprint 3 close — MVP launch)

**Known constraint:** Vercel Hobby plan has a 100GB bandwidth limit per month. Sufficient for a portfolio project.

---

### Repository — GitHub

**Repository:** `github.com/[username]/hiretrace`
**Visibility:** Public
**Default branch:** `main` (protected)
**Integration branch:** `develop`

See §5 for full branch strategy.

## 5. Branch Strategy

### Branch Types

| Branch    | Pattern                      | Purpose                                      | Merges into             |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `main`    | `main`                       | Production-ready code only                   | —                       |
| `develop` | `develop`                    | Integration branch — all features merge here | `main` (at phase gates) |
| Feature   | `feature/PBI-XXX-short-desc` | One branch per PBI                           | `develop`               |

### Rules

- **Never commit directly to `main`** — branch protection enforces this
- **Never commit directly to `develop` for application code** — always use a feature branch
- **Documentation commits** (`/docs` changes only) may go directly to `develop`
- **Feature branch lifecycle:** create from `develop` → develop → open PR → self-review checklist → merge to `develop` → delete branch
- **`main` receives merges** only at sprint close (after review) or phase gate

### Pull Request Self-Review Checklist

Before merging any feature branch to `develop`:

- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes with no warnings
- [ ] `npm test` passes with no failures
- [ ] Manual test against AC in `spec.md`
- [ ] No `console.log` statements left in code
- [ ] No `.env` values hardcoded in any file
- [ ] No `any` types introduced

### Commit Message Convention

```
[PBI-XXX] Short description of what this commit does

Examples:
[PBI-004] Add user registration API route
[PBI-004] Add registration form with Zod validation
[PBI-004] Add RTL tests for registration form
[DOCS] Update tasks.md Sprint 1 progress
```

## 6. Environment Variables

### Full Variable Reference

| Variable          | Scope | Description                                          | Set in               |
| ----------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`    | All   | Neon pooled connection string                        | `.env.local`, Vercel |
| `DIRECT_URL`      | All   | Neon direct connection string (migrations only)      | `.env.local`, Vercel |
| `JWT_SECRET`      | All   | Secret key for signing JWTs — min 32 chars           | `.env.local`, Vercel |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`    | All   | Base URL of the application                          | `.env.local`, Vercel |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | All   | NextAuth secret — reserved for Sprint 6 Google OAuth | `.env.local`, Vercel |

### Generating Secrets

Generate `JWT_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` using:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Run this twice — use one output for each variable. Never reuse secrets across variables.

### Rules

- `.env.local` is never committed — confirmed in `.gitignore`
- `.env.example` is committed with all keys and empty values
- Secrets are never logged, returned in API responses, or hardcoded in source
- Vercel environment variables are set per scope (Preview / Production) — not globally

## 7. Architectural Decision Records

Each ADR records a decision made, the options considered, and the rationale. ADRs are never deleted — superseded decisions are marked and a new ADR is added.

---

### ADR-001 — Next.js App Router over Pages Router

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use Next.js App Router (introduced in Next.js 13, stable in 14+).

**Options considered:**

- App Router — file-based routing in `app/`, Server Components by default, Route Handlers for API
- Pages Router — legacy Next.js routing in `pages/`, API routes in `pages/api/`

**Rationale:** App Router is the current Next.js standard and the direction of the framework. Server Components reduce client bundle size. Route Handlers replace API routes cleanly. Using Pages Router in a 2026 portfolio project signals unfamiliarity with current Next.js.

**Trade-off:** App Router has a steeper learning curve for developers familiar only with Pages Router. Accepted — the project is a learning and showcase artifact.

---

### ADR-002 — jose over jsonwebtoken for JWT

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use `jose` for JWT signing and verification.

**Options considered:**

- `jsonwebtoken` — the most widely known JWT library for Node.js
- `jose` — JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) standard implementation, Edge Runtime compatible

**Rationale:** Next.js middleware runs on the Edge Runtime, which does not support Node.js built-ins that `jsonwebtoken` depends on. `jose` is Edge-compatible and is the library recommended in Next.js documentation for middleware JWT verification.

**Trade-off:** `jose` API is less familiar than `jsonwebtoken` to most developers. Accepted — the API surface used in this project is minimal (SignJWT, jwtVerify).

---

### ADR-003 — HTTP-only Cookie over localStorage for Session Storage

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Store the JWT session token in an HTTP-only cookie.

**Options considered:**

- HTTP-only cookie — set by server, not accessible via JavaScript, sent automatically with requests
- localStorage — accessible via JavaScript, requires manual inclusion in request headers

**Rationale:** HTTP-only cookies are not accessible via `document.cookie` or JavaScript, which eliminates XSS-based token theft. localStorage tokens are vulnerable to any XSS attack on the page. For an auth token, HTTP-only cookie is the correct security posture.

**Trade-off:** Slightly more complex server-side cookie management. Accepted — security is not negotiable for auth token storage.

---

### ADR-004 — Neon over Railway for PostgreSQL Hosting

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use Neon for PostgreSQL hosting.

**Options considered:**

- Railway — $5/month after trial credits exhaust
- Neon — free tier, no credit card required, no expiry
- Supabase — free tier but pauses after 1 week of inactivity
- Vercel Postgres — free on Hobby but tightly coupled to Vercel pricing

**Rationale:** Neon's free tier has no time limit and no monthly cost. Serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling built in. Native Prisma support via `directUrl` for migrations. Compute pauses on inactivity but resumes in under 1 second — acceptable for a portfolio project.

**Trade-off:** Neon free tier has 0.5GB storage limit. Sufficient for HireTrace's data model. Cold start on resume adds latency to the first request after inactivity — acceptable for a portfolio context.

---

### ADR-005 — Prisma over raw SQL or other ORMs

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use Prisma as the ORM.

**Options considered:**

- Prisma — type-safe ORM with schema-first approach and migration system
- Drizzle — lightweight, TypeScript-native ORM
- Raw SQL via `pg` — maximum control, no abstraction
- Sequelize — mature ORM, less TypeScript-native

**Rationale:** Prisma generates fully typed client code from the schema, eliminating an entire class of runtime DB errors. The migration system (`prisma migrate dev`) is straightforward for a solo developer. Prisma Studio provides a free GUI for inspecting data during development. The `schema.prisma` file is also a readable data model document — useful for the portfolio showcase.

**Trade-off:** Prisma adds cold start overhead in serverless environments (Prisma Client initialisation). Mitigated by the singleton pattern in `lib/prisma.ts`. Accepted.

---

### ADR-006 — bcryptjs over bcrypt for Password Hashing

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use `bcryptjs` instead of `bcrypt`.

**Options considered:**

- `bcrypt` — native Node.js bcrypt binding, requires node-gyp compilation
- `bcryptjs` — pure JavaScript bcrypt implementation, no native compilation required

**Rationale:** `bcrypt` requires native compilation via node-gyp, which can fail in certain deployment environments and CI pipelines. `bcryptjs` is a pure JavaScript implementation with identical API and equivalent security. Vercel's build environment handles it without additional configuration.

**Trade-off:** `bcryptjs` is marginally slower than `bcrypt` due to lack of native bindings. At 10 salt rounds and typical auth traffic for a portfolio project, the difference is imperceptible.

---

### ADR-007 — Content Security Policy Trade-offs

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted — under review for Sprint 4

**Decision:** Accept `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline` in the CSP for the current sprint.

**Context:** Next.js requires `unsafe-eval` in development for hot module replacement and `unsafe-inline` for its inline script injection. Removing these breaks the development experience and requires significant CSP tuning.

**Rationale:** For a portfolio project at this stage, the pragmatic trade-off is to accept the looser CSP and revisit in Sprint 4 when the feature set is stable enough to tune the policy without constant breakage.

**Trade-off:** Reduced XSS protection compared to a strict CSP. Accepted at this stage. Sprint 4 backlog item to tighten.

## 8. Known Trade-offs & Constraints

| ID    | Area       | Constraint                                                     | Impact                                        | Sprint to Revisit         |
| ----- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| C-001 | Database   | Neon free tier: 0.5GB storage limit                            | Low — HireTrace data model is lightweight     | —                         |
| C-002 | Database   | Neon compute pauses on inactivity — cold start ~1s             | Low — acceptable for portfolio                | —                         |
| C-003 | Database   | Single Neon instance used for both dev and production          | Medium — no environment isolation             | Sprint 4 if budget allows |
| C-004 | Security   | CSP allows `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline`                   | Medium — reduced XSS protection               | Sprint 4                  |
| C-005 | Deployment | Vercel Hobby plan: 100GB/month bandwidth                       | Low — portfolio traffic                       | —                         |
| C-006 | Auth       | No refresh token — JWT expires after 7 days, requires re-login | Low — acceptable for this use case            | —                         |
| C-007 | Testing    | No E2E tests until Sprint 6                                    | Medium — manual testing covers gap until then | Sprint 6                  |
