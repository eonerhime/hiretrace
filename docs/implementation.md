## 2. Architecture

### Request Lifecycle

```
Browser
  ↓
Vercel Edge Network
  ↓
middleware.ts (JWT verification — runs before every request)
  ↓ (authenticated)              ↓ (unauthenticated)
Next.js App Router          Redirect → /login
  ↓                         401 JSON (API routes)
Page Component / API Route Handler
  ↓
Prisma Client (singleton — lib/prisma.ts)
  ↓
Neon PostgreSQL (pooled connection)
```

### Rendering Strategy

| Route type            | Strategy                   | Reason                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/login`, `/register` | Client Component           | Form interactivity required                                    |
| `/dashboard`          | Server Component (default) | Data fetched server-side; no client state needed at page level |
| `/api/*`              | Route Handler              | REST API — JSON responses                                      |
| `middleware.ts`       | Edge Runtime               | Runs before rendering; must be Edge-compatible                 |

### Auth Flow

```
Register:
  Client → POST /api/auth/register → Zod validate → bcrypt hash → prisma.user.create → 201

Login:
  Client → POST /api/auth/login → Zod validate → prisma.user.findUnique → bcrypt.compare → SignJWT → Set HTTP-only cookie → 200

Protected request:
  Browser sends cookie automatically → middleware.ts reads cookie → jwtVerify → next() or redirect

Logout:
  Client → POST /api/auth/logout → Clear cookie (Max-Age=0) → 200 → client redirects to /login
```

## 4. Infrastructure

### Database — Neon

**Provider:** neon.tech
**Plan:** Free tier
**Engine:** PostgreSQL 17
**Connection mode:** Pooled (runtime) + Direct (migrations)

**Connection string format:**

```
Pooled:  postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST-pooler.region.aws.neon.tech/DATABASE?sslmode=require
Direct:  postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST.region.aws.neon.tech/DATABASE?sslmode=require
```

**Prisma datasource configuration:**

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")      ← pooled — used at runtime
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")        ← direct — used by prisma migrate
}
```

**Known constraint:** Neon free tier pauses compute after a period of inactivity. Cold start on resume is under 1 second. Acceptable for a portfolio project. Not suitable for production applications with SLA requirements.

**Connection string usage:**

- `DATABASE_URL` (pooled) — `lib/prisma.ts` — runtime queries only
- `DIRECT_URL` (direct) — `prisma.config.ts` — all Prisma CLI commands
- Pooled URL throws P1001 on migrate commands — direct URL required for CLI
- `prisma.config.ts` uses `@next/env` `loadEnvConfig` to read `.env.local`

---

### Deployment — Vercel

**Provider:** vercel.com
**Plan:** Hobby (free)
**Trigger:** Push to `develop` → preview deployment. Push to `main` → production deployment.
**Framework preset:** Next.js (auto-detected)
**Build command:** `next build` (default)
**Output directory:** `.next` (default)

**Environment scopes:**

- Preview — `develop` branch deployments
- Production — `main` branch deployments (active from Sprint 3 close — MVP launch)

**Known constraint:** Vercel Hobby plan has a 100GB bandwidth limit per month. Sufficient for a portfolio project.

---

### Repository — GitHub

**Repository:** `github.com/[username]/hiretrace`
**Visibility:** Public
**Default branch:** `main` (protected)
**Integration branch:** `develop`

See §5 for full branch strategy.

## 5. Branch Strategy

### Branch Types

| Branch    | Pattern                      | Purpose                                      | Merges into             |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `main`    | `main`                       | Production-ready code only                   | —                       |
| `develop` | `develop`                    | Integration branch — all features merge here | `main` (at phase gates) |
| Feature   | `feature/PBI-XXX-short-desc` | One branch per PBI                           | `develop`               |

### Rules

- **Create `develop` before your first commit** — the very first action after creating the repository is: create `develop` from `main`, push it, then route all subsequent commits there. Committing directly to `main` and migrating later is avoidable friction.
- **Never commit directly to `main`** — branch protection enforces this; enable it immediately at repo creation
- **Never commit directly to `develop` for application code** — always use a feature branch
- **Documentation commits** (`/docs` changes only) may go directly to `develop`
- **`/docs` folder must be named exactly `docs`** — all cross-references in all SDD documents use this path. Using any other name (`spec`, `documentation`, etc.) breaks every document link.
- **Feature branch lifecycle:** create from `develop` → develop → open PR → self-review checklist → merge to `develop` → delete branch
- **`main` receives merges** only at sprint close (after review) or phase gate

### Pull Request Self-Review Checklist

Before merging any feature branch to `develop`:

- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes with no warnings
- [ ] `npm test` passes with no failures
- [ ] Manual test against AC in `spec.md`
- [ ] No `console.log` statements left in code
- [ ] No `.env` values hardcoded in any file
- [ ] No `any` types introduced

### Commit Message Convention

```
[PBI-XXX] Short description of what this commit does

Examples:
[PBI-004] Add user registration API route
[PBI-004] Add registration form with Zod validation
[PBI-004] Add RTL tests for registration form
[DOCS] Update tasks.md Sprint 1 progress
```

## 6. Environment Variables

### Full Variable Reference

| Variable          | Scope | Description                                          | Set in               |
| ----------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`    | All   | Neon pooled connection string                        | `.env.local`, Vercel |
| `DIRECT_URL`      | All   | Neon direct connection string (migrations only)      | `.env.local`, Vercel |
| `JWT_SECRET`      | All   | Secret key for signing JWTs — min 32 chars           | `.env.local`, Vercel |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`    | All   | Base URL of the application                          | `.env.local`, Vercel |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | All   | NextAuth secret — reserved for Sprint 6 Google OAuth | `.env.local`, Vercel |

### Generating Secrets

Generate `JWT_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` using:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Run this twice — use one output for each variable. Never reuse secrets across variables.

### Rules

- `.env.local` is never committed — confirmed in `.gitignore`
- `.env.example` is committed with all keys and empty values
- Secrets are never logged, returned in API responses, or hardcoded in source
- Vercel environment variables are set per scope (Preview / Production) — not globally

## 7. Architectural Decision Records

Each ADR records a decision made, the options considered, and the rationale. ADRs are never deleted — superseded decisions are marked and a new ADR is added.

---

### ADR-001 — Next.js App Router over Pages Router

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use Next.js App Router (introduced in Next.js 13, stable in 14+).

**Options considered:**

- App Router — file-based routing in `app/`, Server Components by default, Route Handlers for API
- Pages Router — legacy Next.js routing in `pages/`, API routes in `pages/api/`

**Rationale:** App Router is the current Next.js standard and the direction of the framework. Server Components reduce client bundle size. Route Handlers replace API routes cleanly. Using Pages Router in a 2026 portfolio project signals unfamiliarity with current Next.js.

**Trade-off:** App Router has a steeper learning curve for developers familiar only with Pages Router. Accepted — the project is a learning and showcase artifact.

---

### ADR-002 — jose over jsonwebtoken for JWT

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use `jose` for JWT signing and verification.

**Options considered:**

- `jsonwebtoken` — the most widely known JWT library for Node.js
- `jose` — JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) standard implementation, Edge Runtime compatible

**Rationale:** Next.js middleware runs on the Edge Runtime, which does not support Node.js built-ins that `jsonwebtoken` depends on. `jose` is Edge-compatible and is the library recommended in Next.js documentation for middleware JWT verification.

**Trade-off:** `jose` API is less familiar than `jsonwebtoken` to most developers. Accepted — the API surface used in this project is minimal (SignJWT, jwtVerify).

---

### ADR-003 — HTTP-only Cookie over localStorage for Session Storage

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Store the JWT session token in an HTTP-only cookie.

**Options considered:**

- HTTP-only cookie — set by server, not accessible via JavaScript, sent automatically with requests
- localStorage — accessible via JavaScript, requires manual inclusion in request headers

**Rationale:** HTTP-only cookies are not accessible via `document.cookie` or JavaScript, which eliminates XSS-based token theft. localStorage tokens are vulnerable to any XSS attack on the page. For an auth token, HTTP-only cookie is the correct security posture.

**Trade-off:** Slightly more complex server-side cookie management. Accepted — security is not negotiable for auth token storage.

---

### ADR-004 — Neon over Railway for PostgreSQL Hosting

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use Neon for PostgreSQL hosting.

**Options considered:**

- Railway — $5/month after trial credits exhaust
- Neon — free tier, no credit card required, no expiry
- Supabase — free tier but pauses after 1 week of inactivity
- Vercel Postgres — free on Hobby but tightly coupled to Vercel pricing

**Rationale:** Neon's free tier has no time limit and no monthly cost. Serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling built in. Native Prisma support via `directUrl` for migrations. Compute pauses on inactivity but resumes in under 1 second — acceptable for a portfolio project.

**Trade-off:** Neon free tier has 0.5GB storage limit. Sufficient for HireTrace's data model. Cold start on resume adds latency to the first request after inactivity — acceptable for a portfolio context.

---

### ADR-005 — Prisma over raw SQL or other ORMs

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use Prisma as the ORM.

**Options considered:**

- Prisma — type-safe ORM with schema-first approach and migration system
- Drizzle — lightweight, TypeScript-native ORM
- Raw SQL via `pg` — maximum control, no abstraction
- Sequelize — mature ORM, less TypeScript-native

**Rationale:** Prisma generates fully typed client code from the schema, eliminating an entire class of runtime DB errors. The migration system (`prisma migrate dev`) is straightforward for a solo developer. Prisma Studio provides a free GUI for inspecting data during development. The `schema.prisma` file is also a readable data model document — useful for the portfolio showcase.

**Trade-off:** Prisma adds cold start overhead in serverless environments (Prisma Client initialisation). Mitigated by the singleton pattern in `lib/prisma.ts`. Accepted.

---

### ADR-006 — bcryptjs over bcrypt for Password Hashing

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use `bcryptjs` instead of `bcrypt`.

**Options considered:**

- `bcrypt` — native Node.js bcrypt binding, requires node-gyp compilation
- `bcryptjs` — pure JavaScript bcrypt implementation, no native compilation required

**Rationale:** `bcrypt` requires native compilation via node-gyp, which can fail in certain deployment environments and CI pipelines. `bcryptjs` is a pure JavaScript implementation with identical API and equivalent security. Vercel's build environment handles it without additional configuration.

**Trade-off:** `bcryptjs` is marginally slower than `bcrypt` due to lack of native bindings. At 10 salt rounds and typical auth traffic for a portfolio project, the difference is imperceptible.

---

### ADR-007 — Content Security Policy Trade-offs

**Date:** April 17, 2026
**Status:** Accepted — under review for Sprint 4

**Decision:** Accept `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline` in the CSP for the current sprint.

**Context:** Next.js requires `unsafe-eval` in development for hot module replacement and `unsafe-inline` for its inline script injection. Removing these breaks the development experience and requires significant CSP tuning.

**Rationale:** For a portfolio project at this stage, the pragmatic trade-off is to accept the looser CSP and revisit in Sprint 4 when the feature set is stable enough to tune the policy without constant breakage.

**Trade-off:** Reduced XSS protection compared to a strict CSP. Accepted at this stage. Sprint 4 backlog item to tighten.

---

### ADR-008 — Tailwind CSS v4 Syntax

**Date:** April 19, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use single import syntax in `app/globals.css`.

**Context:** Next.js 16 installs Tailwind v4. The `@tailwind base`,
`@tailwind components`, and `@tailwind utilities` directives no longer
exist. `tailwind.config.ts` is not required in v4.

**Change:** `app/globals.css` contains a single line:
`@import "tailwindcss";`

---

### ADR-009 — Prisma v6 Configuration Pattern

**Date:** April 19, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use Prisma v6 `defineConfig` pattern with dual connection
strings and `@prisma/client` import path.

**Context:** Prisma v6 introduced three breaking changes:

1. Connection URLs moved from `schema.prisma` to `prisma.config.ts`
2. `dotenv/config` does not read `.env.local` — use `@next/env` `loadEnvConfig`
3. Generated client moved from `@prisma/client` to `@prisma/clienta`
4. Pooled Neon URL throws P1001 on all Prisma CLI commands — `DIRECT_URL`
   required in `prisma.config.ts`; `DATABASE_URL` used only in `lib/prisma.ts`

**Changes:**

- `schema.prisma` datasource block contains no `url` or `directUrl`
- `prisma.config.ts` uses `loadEnvConfig` and `DIRECT_URL`
- `lib/prisma.ts` uses `DATABASE_URL` at runtime
- All Prisma imports use `from '@prisma/clienta'`

### ADR-010 — Prisma v7 Requires Database Adapter

**Date:** April 19, 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use `PrismaNeon` adapter from `@prisma/adapter-neon` for all
Prisma client construction.

**Context:** Prisma v7 removed adapterless client construction. Calling
`new PrismaClient()` without an adapter throws `PrismaClientInitializationError`
at runtime. Three adapter patterns were attempted before finding the correct one:

1. `datasourceUrl` property — does not exist in v7 type definitions
2. `datasources.db.url` property — does not exist in v7 type definitions
3. `new PrismaNeon(pool)` with Pool instance — type mismatch
4. `new PrismaNeon(sql)` with neon() function — type mismatch
5. `new PrismaNeon({ connectionString })` config object — correct ✅

**Change:** `lib/prisma.ts` uses `PrismaNeon` with a `connectionString` config
object. Requires `@neondatabase/serverless` and `@prisma/adapter-neon`.

---

### ADR-011 — Pin Next.js to 15.x

**Date:** 20 April 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Pin Next.js to 15.5.15 — do not upgrade to v16.

**Context:** Next.js 16 deprecated `middleware.ts` in favour of `proxy.ts`
with a renamed export function. Vercel's infrastructure does not yet support
the `proxy` convention — all routes returned 404. Downgrading to v15.5.15
resolved the issue immediately.

**Rule:** Do not run `npm install next@latest` at any point during this
project. If Next.js must be updated, test on a branch first.

---

### ADR-012 — Pin Prisma to 5.x

**Date:** 20 April 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Pin Prisma to 5.22.0 — do not upgrade to v6 or v7.

**Context:** Prisma v6 and v7 introduced three breaking changes incompatible
with this project's Vercel deployment:

1. Database URL moved from `schema.prisma` to `prisma.config.ts`
2. Client requires a database adapter — `new PrismaClient()` throws without one
3. WASM-based adapter caused `undefined` module errors on Vercel serverless

Prisma v5.22.0 works cleanly with the standard singleton pattern and no adapter.

**Rule:** Do not run `npm install prisma@latest` at any point during this
project.

---

### ADR-013 — Web Crypto API in Middleware Instead of jose

**Date:** 20 April 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use native Web Crypto API for JWT verification in `middleware.ts`.

**Context:** `jose` imports Node.js APIs (`CompressionStream`,
`DecompressionStream`) via its `webapi` entry point which are unavailable
on Vercel's Edge Runtime. All jose import paths — including subpaths like
`jose/jwt/verify` — were rejected by Vercel's Edge Function bundler.

**Change:** `middleware.ts` uses `crypto.subtle` for JWT verification.
`jose` is retained in `lib/jwt.ts` for token signing in API routes which
run on Node.js runtime.'

---

### ADR-014 — @hello-pangea/dnd pinned to 18.0.1

**Date:** 22 April 2026
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use @hello-pangea/dnd@18.0.1 instead of the planned 16.6.0.

**Context:** 16.6.0 declares peer dependency on React ^16 || ^17 || ^18.
Project is on React 19.2.4. npm install fails with ERESOLVE.
18.0.1 explicitly declares React ^18 || ^19 support.

## **Rule:** Do not downgrade to 16.6.0 or use --legacy-peer-deps.

## 8. Known Trade-offs & Constraints

### Pre-Sprint — April 17, 2026

**Status:** Complete

**Infrastructure established:**

- GitHub repository `hiretrace` created — public, Node.js `.gitignore`
- `README.md` placeholder committed to `main` at repo creation
- `develop` branch created from `main` immediately — before any SDD document commits
- `main` branch protected (PR required before merge)
- All SDD document commits routed to `develop` — not `main`
- `/docs` directory created on `develop` with exact name `docs`
- Vercel project connected to GitHub — preview deployments on push to `develop`
- Notion workspace created and published publicly
- Neon account active — PostgreSQL instance to be provisioned at Sprint 1 start (PBI-002)

**Documents committed to `/docs` on `develop`:**

- `product.md` v1.0
- `plan.md` v1.0
- `spec.md` v1.0 (Sprint 1 slice)
- `linkedin.md` v2.0
- `notion-setup.md` v1.0
- `features.md` v1.0 (Sprint 1 slice)
- `tasks.md` v1.0 (Sprint 1 slice)
- `implementation.md` v1.0 (this document)
- `testing.md` v1.0
- `sprints/sprint-01.md` v1.0

**Architectural decisions recorded:** ADR-001 through ADR-007

**Stack locked:** Next.js 15, TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, Zod, react-hook-form, jose, bcryptjs, RTL, Jest, Neon, Vercel

**Version corrections (actual installed versions):**

- Next.js 16.x (not 15 as planned — create-next-app pulled latest)
- Tailwind CSS 4.x (breaking change from v3 — globals.css updated)
- Prisma 6.x (breaking changes — prisma.config.ts pattern, @prisma/client import)
- PostgreSQL 17 on Neon (not 16 — Neon default)
- Prisma client v7.7.0 (requires adapter pattern — see ADR-010)
- Added dependencies: `@neondatabase/serverless`, `@prisma/adapter-neon`, `@next/env`

### Sprint 1 — Closed 20 April 2026

**Goal:** Foundation + Auth
**Result:** All 11 PBIs complete. 0 carried over.

**Stack versions confirmed and locked:**

- Next.js 15.5.15 — v16 deprecated middleware in favour of proxy convention not yet supported on Vercel
- Tailwind CSS 4.x — `@import "tailwindcss"` replaces three `@tailwind` directives
- Prisma 5.22.0 — v6/v7 WASM incompatible with Vercel serverless functions
- PostgreSQL 17 on Neon
- jose 5.x — API routes only; middleware uses Web Crypto API

**Vercel configuration confirmed:**

- Framework preset must be explicitly set to Next.js at project creation
- `develop` → Preview environment; `main` → Production environment
- `postinstall: prisma generate` required in `package.json`
- `DATABASE_URL` must use pooled Neon string without `channel_binding=require`
- `prisma.config.ts` does not exist in Prisma v5 — delete if auto-generated

**Development rules confirmed:**

- Always run `npm run build` locally before pushing to Vercel
- Never use `@latest` when installing packages — pin versions explicitly
- `globals.css` uses `@import "tailwindcss"` — not `@tailwind` directives
