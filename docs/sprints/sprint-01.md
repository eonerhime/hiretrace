## Sprint Goal

**The project infrastructure is live and a user can register and log in securely.**

At sprint close: the Next.js application is scaffolded, deployed to Vercel, connected to a Neon PostgreSQL database via Prisma, and a user can register with an email and password, log in, receive a JWT session cookie, and be blocked from protected routes without a valid session.

**Total PBIs:** 11 · **S:** 7 · **M:** 4 · **L:** 0
**Estimated dev hours:** ~19.5 hrs · **Available dev capacity:** 11 hrs/sprint
**Note:** Sprint 1 is tight by raw sizing. PBI-046 (Notion) and PBI-007 (GitHub) are already complete per pre-sprint setup — this frees approximately 3 hours of sprint capacity.

## Sprint Retrospective (19 May 2026)

**Date completed:**
21 Apr 2026

### What went well?

- All 11 PBIs completed with zero carry-over — 100% sprint goal achievement
- Auth flow works end-to-end locally and on Vercel
- SDD documentation comprehensive and ahead of schedule before coding started
- Breaking changes identified and resolved systematically — each fix documented immediately
- Control documents updated in real time — future sprints inherit accurate knowledge

### What didn't go well?

- Version conflicts consumed majority of sprint time — Next.js 16, Prisma v6/v7, Tailwind v4 all introduced breaking changes not captured in setup.md
- 9 Vercel deployment iterations required to resolve middleware and framework issues
- No version pinning strategy at project start — @latest installs caused cascading problems
- setup.md was written for versions that weren't actually installed
- Control documents required multiple correction passes as each issue was discovered
- Vercel framework preset not verified at project connection — caused all-routes-404 issue

### What will change in Sprint 2?

- All packages pinned to specific versions — never @latest
- npm run build run locally before every Vercel push — non-negotiable
- Vercel framework preset verified immediately at project connection
- Control documents updated in a single pass at sprint close

### Retro insight for LinkedIn Post 10

- Sprint 1 shipped on time. All 11 PBIs complete.
  But the most expensive line of code I wrote this sprint was: npx create-next-app@latest
- @latest installed Next.js 16. Prisma @latest installed v7.
  Both broke Vercel in different ways. 9 deployments to fix.
- Sprint 2 rule: every package version is pinned before install.
  The 30 seconds it takes to check the version number is cheaper than the hours it takes to debug a breaking change you didn't
  see coming.
