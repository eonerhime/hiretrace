## Sprint Goal

**The MVP is complete. Users can track contacts per application, set follow-up reminders, and see their pipeline state at a glance on the dashboard.**

At sprint close: contact tracking is functional, the overdue follow-up indicator is verified, the summary stats bar renders on the dashboard, the pipeline stage distribution is visible, general notes are available per application, and README.md is complete. Phase 1 MVP gate is cleared.

**Status markers:** `[ ]` Not started · `[~]` In progress · `[x]` Done · `[!]` Blocked

**Total PBIs:** 9 · **S:** 3 · **M:** 6 · **L:** 0
**Estimated dev hours:** ~27 hrs · **Available dev capacity:** 31 hrs/sprint
**Note:** PBI-020 and PBI-021 were partially implemented in Sprint 2 (`followUpAt` field and overdue indicator) but were not in the Sprint 2 DoD. They are formally committed here and require DoD verification against spec.md acceptance criteria before being marked done.

## Dependency Order

PBI-017 (contact model) → PBI-018 (add/edit contact) → PBI-019 (contact list view)
PBI-020 (follow-up date field) → PBI-021 (overdue indicator)
PBI-024 (summary stats bar) → PBI-025 (pipeline chart)
PBI-029 (notes field) — independent, implement after PBI-019
PBI-043 (README) — last, written when all features are visible

## Sprint 2 Lessons Applied

| #   | Lesson                                                                      | Change Applied                                                               |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | DoD items without explicit verification methods caused mid-sprint confusion | Every DoD check uses the three-column table format: Confirmed / How / Item   |
| 2   | Missing `htmlFor`/`id` pairs on form inputs broke RTL tests                 | All form inputs ship with `htmlFor`/`id` pairs — enforced as coding standard |
| 3   | Jest `moduleNameMapper` and `@jest-environment node` not documented         | Both confirmed in place from Sprint 2 — no setup cost this sprint            |
| 4   | `ApplicationCard.test.tsx` and `KanbanBoard.test.tsx` not executed          | Executed and passing before Sprint 3 closes                                  |

## Sprint Retrospective (29 April 2026)

**Date completed:** 24 April 2026

### What went well?

Dashboard MVP came together cleanly — StatsBar and PipelineChart built and integrated in a single session with no rework. Contact model, API routes, and form components completed with 10 tests passing. Spec-Driven Development discipline held throughout: branch-first, then document, no scope drift. The three-column DoD table format carried forward from Sprint 2 removed all ambiguity from verification checks.

### What didn't go well?

Browser verification PBIs (PBI-020, PBI-021, PBI-029) were scoped as "no new code" but clustered at the end of the sprint. They still require deliberate checklist discipline and occupied more closing-day attention than planned. PBI-019 wiring was broader than its S size suggested — coordinating Prisma query includes, component props, and routing added surface area that a standalone story estimate would not have caught.

### What will change in Sprint 4?

Browser verification PBIs get an explicit time block at sprint open, not at sprint close. README (PBI-043) opens the sprint — writing it first forces a clean articulation of what actually exists and surfaces gaps early. Story sizing review: any PBI that touches Prisma, a component, and a route in combination gets bumped to M regardless of apparent scope.

### Retro insight for LinkedIn Post 24

Verification PBIs look like free points until they stack up on the last day. Sprint 3 closed clean, but the browser-check work bunched at the end rather than being distributed across the week. Sprint 4 opens with a dedicated verification block on day one — small change, meaningful difference to close-day pressure.
