**Pre-sprint deliverables (before Sprint 1 kickoff):**

- [ ] GitHub repository created (`hiretrace`, public, Node.js `.gitignore`)
- [ ] `README.md` placeholder committed to `main` (GitHub requires this at repo creation)
- [ ] `develop` branch created from `main` immediately — before any further commits
- [ ] Branch protection enabled on `main` (Settings → Branches → Require PR before merging)
- [ ] All subsequent commits go to `develop` — never directly to `main`
- [ ] `/docs` directory created on `develop` — name must be `docs`, not `spec` or any other name; cross-references throughout all SDD documents depend on this exact path
- [ ] All SDD documents committed to `/docs` on `develop`: `product.md`, `plan.md`, `spec.md`, `linkedin.md`, `notion-setup.md`, `features.md`, `tasks.md`, `implementation.md`, `testing.md`
- [ ] `/docs/sprints/` subdirectory created; `sprint-01.md` committed there
- [ ] Branch strategy documented in `README.md` and `implementation.md`
- [ ] Notion workspace created and shared publicly (follow `notion-setup.md`)
- [ ] Canva brand kit and carousel template set up (see linkedin.md)
- [ ] Neon PostgreSQL instance provisioned (free at neon.tech — no credit card required)
- [ ] Vercel project connected to GitHub repo (dev environment — preview on `develop` push)

## 2. Capacity Model

### Assumptions

HireTrace is a solo project. The developer is also Product Owner, Scrum Master, Tester, and Documenter. Capacity must account for all five roles, not just implementation time.

**Available hours per week:** 10 hours
**Sprint duration:** 2 weeks
**Raw hours per sprint:** 20 hours

### Role Time Allocation Per Sprint

| Role          | % of Capacity | Hours per Sprint | Activities                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Developer     | 55%           | 11 hours         | Implementation, debugging, code review                      |
| Tester        | 20%           | 4 hours          | RTL tests, integration tests, E2E (Sprint 6)                |
| Documenter    | 10%           | 2 hours          | spec.md authoring, implementation.md updates, sprint-XX.md  |
| Product Owner | 10%           | 2 hours          | Backlog refinement, acceptance criteria review, PBI updates |
| Scrum Master  | 5%            | 1 hour           | Planning, retro, checkpoint, linkedin.md post publishing    |

**Net implementation capacity:** 11 hours per sprint

### Sizing Reference (from product.md)

| Size | Effort    | Hours Modelled As |
| ---- | --------- | ----------------- |
| S    | < 2 hours | 1.5 hours         |
| M    | 2–4 hours | 3 hours           |
| L    | 4–8 hours | 6 hours           |
| XL   | > 8 hours | Decompose         |

### Capacity vs. Backlog Fit Check

| Sprint   | PBIs Planned                           | S Count | M Count | L Count | Est. Hours | Capacity | Fit      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| Sprint 1 | PBI-001–008, PBI-037, PBI-039, PBI-046 | 5       | 4       | 0       | 19.5       | 11 dev   | ✅ Tight |
| Sprint 2 | PBI-009–016, PBI-040                   | 1       | 4       | 4       | 40.5       | 11 dev   | ⚠️ Heavy |
| Sprint 3 | PBI-017–025, PBI-043                   | 2       | 8       | 0       | 27         | 11 dev   | ⚠️ Heavy |
| Sprint 4 | PBI-026–031, PBI-038, PBI-041, PBI-044 | 0       | 5       | 4       | 39         | 11 dev   | ⚠️ Heavy |
| Sprint 5 | PBI-032–034, PBI-022–023               | 1       | 2       | 2       | 19.5       | 11 dev   | ✅ Tight |
| Sprint 6 | PBI-035–036, PBI-042, PBI-045 (final)  | 1       | 2       | 1       | 13.5       | 11 dev   | ✅ Fit   |

**Note on ⚠️ Heavy sprints:** Sprints 2, 3, and 4 are load-heavy when all PBIs are sized raw. The Scrum Master will use the first mid-sprint checkpoint of each heavy sprint to reassess progress and apply the overflow rule below.

**Overflow rule:** If more than 30% of planned PBIs are not in progress by the mid-sprint checkpoint, one PBI is deprioritised to the next sprint's backlog. Overflow items are added to the next sprint's planning session, not dropped.
